There are three datasets available as input for fMLC. The "small" dataset contains ~4000 ITS yeast sequences, checked and validated by the specialists at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. This dataset were analyzed and released in [Vu D. et al. 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5192050/). The "large" dataset contains ~350K ITS fungal sequences downloaded from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) which was used in  [Vu D. et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06837) to evaluate the speed of MLC. The smallest dataset is the Fusarium dataset of 85 Actin sequences from 14 species.

The embedded files (in .json format) of the two datasets can be uploaded directly from https://nlesc.github.io/DiVE/ for a quick inspection. Manual for DiVE is at https://github.com/NLeSC/DiVE .
