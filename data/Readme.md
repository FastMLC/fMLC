There are two datasets available as inputs for fMLC. The "small" dataset contains ~4000 ITS yeast sequences, checked and validated by the specialists at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. This dataset were analyzed and released in [Vu D. et al. 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5192050/). The "large" dataset contains ~350K ITS fungal sequences downloaded from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) which was used in  [Vu D. et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06837) to evaluate the speed of MLC. 

The clustering results of the two datasets can be found at https://github.com/FastMLC/fMLC/tree/master/data/ClusteringResults.

The visualization results (the coordinates computed by LargeVis and the embedded files in .json format) of the two datasets can be found at https://github.com/FastMLC/fMLC/tree/master/data/VisualizationResults. For the small dataset, a sparse similarity matrix is also given. For the large dataset, the similarity matrix cannot be uploaded due to the big size. The embedded files (in .json format) can be uploaded directly to https://nlesc.github.io/DiVE/ for a quick inspection. Manual for DiVE is at https://github.com/NLeSC/DiVE .
