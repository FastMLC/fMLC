There are two datasets available as input for fMLC. The "small" dataset contains ~4000 ITS yeast sequences, checked and validated by the specialists at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. The "large" dataset contains ~350K ITS fungal sequences, downloaded from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

The embedded dataset files can be uploaded directly from https://nlesc.github.io/DiVE/ for a quick inspection.
Manual for DiVE is at https://github.com/NLeSC/DiVE .
